You are building a file sharing system intended to be used by ordinary people (e.g. your grandmother or other people with no computer skills whatsoever). One option in this system is to browse by filename. If people choose "sort by filename", then files should be sorted in the manner that helps them find the file they are looking for as quickly as possible.
